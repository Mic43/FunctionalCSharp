# FunctionalCSharp

Project trying to simulate basic typeclasses in c#: functor, monad, applicative and some of basic implementations like Maybe, Result (Haskell's Either equivalent), Reader and simple Async implementation.
Base classes use new C# language features, like static abstract interface methods, and recursive generic parameters.
Also, there is support for query syntax, which mimics (to some extent) Haskell do notation and F# computation expressions.
