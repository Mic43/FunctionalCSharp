# FunctionalCSharp

Library containing basic Haskell's typeclasses in c#: **Functor**, **Monad**, **Applicative** and some of basic implementations like _Maybe_, _Result_ (Haskell's Either equivalent), _Reader_ and simple _Async_ implementation.
With this library You can easily create custom **DSL's** by using **Free** monad implementation. Custom languages can be easily combined using **Cofunctor** typeclass and natural transformation between functors.
Libary uses new C# language features, like static abstract interface methods, and recursive generic parameters.
Also, there is support for query syntax, which mimics (to some extent) Haskell do notation and F# computation expressions.
