# FunctionalCSharp

Library containing basic Haskell's typeclasses in c#: Functor, Monad, Applicative and some of basic implementations like Maybe, Result (Haskell's Either equivalent), Reader and simple Async implementation.
With this library You can easily create custom DSL's by using Free monad implementation. Custom languages can be easily combined using Cofunctor typeclass and natural transformation between functors.
Libary uses new C# language features, like static abstract interface methods, and recursive generic parameters.
Also, there is support for query syntax, which mimics (to some extent) Haskell do notation and F# computation expressions.
